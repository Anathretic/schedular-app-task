# Schedular App Task

## About
This is a recruitment task for one of the companies I applied to. I enjoyed the whole task because I have experience in Firebase and learned how to build a schedular app!

## Features that I would add/fixed
- implementation of a Polish date when creating an event (I tried, but I don't know how)

## Links & Tools
**Used:** JavaScript, React, [React Scheduler](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/scheduler/), Mui.
